🌊 Types of Water Pollution (Detailed)
1. Surface Water Pollution

Surface water includes all water sources that are open to the atmosphere such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, and oceans.
This type of pollution happens when contaminants directly enter these visible water bodies.

Major sources:

Untreated sewage from households and cities

Industrial effluents released without filtration

Dumping of plastics, food waste, flowers, and solid waste

Religious offerings and idol immersion in rivers/lakes

Stormwater carrying pollutants from roads and urban areas

Impacts:

Makes water unsafe for drinking and bathing

Reduces sunlight penetration, affecting aquatic plants

Decreases oxygen levels, leading to death of fish

Produces toxic foam and foul smell (common in urban lakes)

Harms biodiversity and disrupts ecosystems

Indian examples:

Ganga & Yamuna rivers contaminated by sewage and industrial discharge

Bellandur and Varthur lakes (Bengaluru) filled with toxic foam

Unkal Lake (Hubbali) polluted by domestic and commercial waste

2. Groundwater Pollution

Groundwater is the water stored below the earth’s surface in aquifers.
Unlike surface pollution, this is invisible and spreads slowly, making it harder to detect and clean.

Major sources:

Agricultural chemicals (fertilizers and pesticides)

Leaking septic tanks and underground sewage pipes

Landfill waste seepage

Contaminated water from mining areas

Improper disposal of chemicals and paints

Impacts:

Contaminates wells and borewells used for drinking

Causes long-term health problems since pollutants remain trapped underground

Expensive and difficult to purify once polluted

Can spread for kilometers under soil

Risks:

Fluoride, arsenic, nitrate contamination is common in several Indian states

Affects rural areas heavily where groundwater is the main source of drinking water

3. Chemical Pollution

Occurs when toxic and hazardous chemicals mix with water bodies.

Major sources:

Factories releasing lead, mercury, chromium, and acids

Oil refineries and petrochemical plants

Mining activities releasing heavy metals

Oil spills from ships and storage leaks

Household cleaners and detergents

Impacts:

Causes cancer, organ damage, hormonal imbalance in humans

Toxic for aquatic life even in small quantities

Metals like mercury and lead accumulate in fish → enters human food chain

Can permanently damage water quality

4. Biological (Microbial) Pollution

Caused by disease-causing microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and parasites.

Major sources:

Untreated sewage and open drains

Animal waste near water bodies

Contaminated drinking water pipelines

Stagnant dirty water

Impacts on health:

Waterborne diseases such as:

Cholera

Typhoid

Diarrhea

Dysentery

Hepatitis A

Polio (in extreme cases from contaminated water)

Impacts on environment:

Spreads infections among aquatic organisms

Unsafe for public use

5. Nutrient Pollution

Happens when excessive nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) enter water, mainly from farming.

Major sources:

Agricultural runoff from fields

Livestock waste

Discharge from food-processing industries

Environmental process:

Causes Algal Bloom → algae grows rapidly on surface

Algae consumes oxygen at night → leads to hypoxic conditions

Low oxygen causes mass death of fish and organisms

Impacts:

Turns water green, dirty, and smelly

Kills aquatic animals due to oxygen depletion

Blocks sunlight for underwater plants

Disturbs the entire food chain

6. Plastic Pollution

A rapidly increasing form of pollution where plastic waste and microplastics accumulate in water.

Major sources:

Plastic bags, bottles, food wrappers, and packaging waste

Microbeads from cosmetics

Synthetic fiber shedding from clothes during washing

Waste carried through open drains to lakes and seas

Impacts:

Non-biodegradable → stays for 400–500+ years

Aquatic animals swallow plastic → causes death

Microplastics enter drinking water and food chain

Blocks drainage leading to floods, which again pollutes clean water

7. Thermal Pollution

Occurs when industries release hot water into natural water bodies, increasing temperature.

Major sources:

Power plants

Manufacturing industries using water for cooling

Steel and chemical industries

Impacts:

Warm water holds less oxygen → aquatic life suffers

Sudden temperature changes kill sensitive species

Disrupts breeding cycles of fish and amphibians

Affects metabolic balance of water ecosystems

8. Oil Pollution

Caused by release or leakage of oil into oceans or freshwater sources.

Major sources:

Oil spills from ships and tankers

Offshore drilling accidents

Oil storage leaks

Fuel discharge from industries

Impacts:

Forms a thick layer on water → blocks oxygen and sunlight

Marine animals, birds, and fish die due to suffocation or poisoning

Damages coral reefs and ocean ecology

Cleanup is costly and takes years
